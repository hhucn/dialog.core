= dialog.core

This repository contains the core logic needed to conduct a dialog-based discussion.
Everything here is highly unstable at the current time.
Do *not* assume that the methods do not change.

== Usage as a Library

To properly use the dialog.core as a library you need to call the
`discussion.database/init` function with a configuration parameter first. It
needs to have at least two keys: `:datomic`, a datomic config map, and
`:name` with a database-name as value.

== Local Development

We are using `datomic dev-local` as our in-memory database, which can be used
during development and testing. Get the jar file containing datomic via this
URL: https://docs.datomic.com/dev-local/get-dev-local.html

Then, store the jar in "local_jars/dev-local/dev-local.jar". This database
stores the data in a ".datomic" folder. Remove it to reset the database.

=== CLI

You can discuss on the console to test your discussion flow. Use the CLI in
`dialog.cli.core/-main` to start it.
